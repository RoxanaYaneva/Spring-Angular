        <p>

          in 1978, the Philadelphia-based company has sold millions of

          interactive game store, RoxStar Games publishes a world-renowned catalog devoted

      <div id="whatmakes">
        <h3>Q: What makes RoxStar Games different from other game oriented web sites?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Because we're game specialists and not data marketers, we know
          the game market better than anyone else. The RoxStar Games web site focuses on all the
          titles that are currently available on game. You'll find thousands of titles that other
          sites don't have. We don't list games that were never on game or have been discontinued.
          Plus, we ship from our own warehouse and don't rely on anyone else to
          stock or ship your merchandise. We also have an 800 number (1-800-668-4344) where you can
          speak to one of our customer service representatives to ask questions about orders already
          placed.
